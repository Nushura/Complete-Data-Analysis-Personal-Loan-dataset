# Complete-Data-Analysis-Personal-Loan-dataset
Carried out a complete data analysis on Personal loan dataset.

•	Studied the dataset using heatmap, pie-chart, histograms, bar charts, and scatterplots.
•	Managed missing values by dropping rows that contained missing values.
•	Handled outliers per attribute by replacing the outlier values with the median.
•	Transformed the data frame by scaling and discretising continuous variables, label encoding and one hot encoding.
•	Used Decision tree and kNN clustering for classification.
•	Measured performance of each classification model using confusion matrix, recall, precision and f1 score due to the unbalanced nature of the personal loan dataset.
•	Improved model by tuning parameters and feature selection.
•	Evaluated kNN and Decision Tree model with all features and selected features with stronger correlation. The evaluation result showed that the Decision Tree model performs better in determining the characteristics of people who would most likely take a personal loan.

The personal loan campaign, introduced last year, attracted fifteen per cent of Crédit Nationale Azur’s customers. No proper method was used to target appropriate clients, so a lower percentage of individuals got involved with the campaign and took loans. There are always costs associated with launching any campaign, and in addition, if it is unsuccessful, then in return, the price rises even more.

Therefore, the business problem that needs to be addressed is to lower the cost and increase the success rate of campaigns. As Crédit Nationale Azur intends to relaunch a similar campaign and thus, to solve the business issue, customer data from the previous campaign needs to be analysed. The data contains specific characteristics of clients, which consists of customer id, age, years of work experience, family size, education level, income level, mortgage amount if they have a credit card account, monthly credit card spending if they have a shared trading account, fixed deposit account, or online banking account and lastly, the result of if they took a personal loan during the last campaign.

Hence to address the problem at hand, an appropriate machine learning algorithm will be used to create a model for predicting which customers are likely to accept personal loan offers. Analysing the data set from the previous campaign will assist in understanding the characteristics of the clients who are most likely to take personal loans. Thus, those individuals can be targeted for the campaign. Furthermore, having the information regarding the number of clients most likely to take loans will assist Crédit Nationale Azur in preparing and making a cost estimation required for the campaign. This will prevent the bank from making additional spending. Hence, Crédit Nationale Azur can efficiently utilise its cost and have a better personal loan campaign success percentage.
