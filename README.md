# Complete-Data-Analysis-Personal-Loan-dataset
Carried out a complete data analysis on Personal loan dataset.

•	Studied the dataset using heatmap, pie-chart, histograms, bar charts, and scatterplots.
•	Managed missing values by dropping rows that contained missing values.
•	Handled outliers per attribute by replacing the outlier values with the median.
•	Transformed the data frame by scaling and discretising continuous variables, label encoding and one hot encoding.
•	Used Decision tree and kNN clustering for classification.
•	Measured performance of each classification model using confusion matrix, recall, precision and f1 score due to the unbalanced nature of the personal loan dataset.
•	Improved model by tuning parameters and feature selection.
•	Evaluated kNN and Decision Tree model with all features and selected features with stronger correlation. The evaluation result showed that the Decision Tree model performs better in determining the characteristics of people who would most likely take a personal loan.
